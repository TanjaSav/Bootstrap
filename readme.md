Bootstrap
-----------

I used Bootstrap for the framework with CND link to connect online to the Bootstrap.

I created a Responsive Navbar,  Image Carousel, Three Column Section,  Two Column Section, Footer and Socket. 

The section Services has a clickable link Read More, so if you click on it, you will be transfered to the particular page where is more content about it. 
It will open on a new tab.
